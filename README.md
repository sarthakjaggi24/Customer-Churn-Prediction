# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). By analyzing customer data such as tenure and monthly charges, the model identifies patterns to predict whether a customer will leave the company. The goal is to help the company retain at-risk customers.
